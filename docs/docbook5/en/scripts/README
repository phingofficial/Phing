SCRIPT Notice
=============

This directory contain custom script(s) to make it easier to build the version of the
manual with the syntax highlighting enabled. This uses the highlight functionality
available in docbook5 together which in turn uses xslthl-2.x.x

The xslthl-2.x.x must therefore be installed into the Java CLASSPATH. 
(Download from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslthl/files/xslthl )

Three more cautions:

 * This script has only been tested on OpenSuSE and is currently setup to work
   with 12.3 in terms of naming conventions.

 * This assumes that the path to the DocBook stylesheets are

      /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheets/nwalsh5/current

   Mutatis mutandis.

 * Saxon 6.x.x Java xslt processor must be installed (and available in the
   Java CLASSPATH)

 * Depending on your system the necessary "saxon.jar" may be named "saxon6.jar" in which
   case you need to updated the script with the correct name. The same goes for the exact
   version of xslthl you have insatlled. As of this writing the latest version is 2.1.0

 * 'xmllint' must be available since that is used to pre-process the xinclude
   to create a flattened XML version of the manual.


Yes, all this is a PITA. But there is no other way to get easy Syntax highlight in DocBoook
besides rolling a completely homegrown solution which is probably even worse. One option
might be to use dynamic highlitning with Javascipt (i.e. JQuery) for the HTML rendering but 
that will not work for PDF output anyway.
